          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p> This Privacy Policy explains what data is collected when you use the NearHermitCraft Minecraft server network and related services, how that data is used, how it is stored, and what rights you have. </p>
          <p> We only collect data that is needed to run, secure, and improve the server. This includes basic connection information and gameplay statistics that help admins understand server health and player activity. </p>
          <p> Some features linked from this site are run by third parties and may collect data under their own privacy policies. </p>
          <p> NearHermitCraft will <b>never</b> sell your data. All data is stored locally in a pseudonymised format and is only shared when required for functionality, anonymised, or with appropriate consent. </p>
          <p> Our services are <b>not intended for children under the age of 18.</b>&nbsp;By using NearHermitCraft and its related services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. </p>

          <p>Player Analytics data is gathered and stored locally on the server and is not transferred to third parties. <br> Transfer of this data to a third party will require consent of all parties involved, unless the pseudonymised user data is removed/anonymized before the transfer. </p>
          <p>If there is a data breach the owner of the server will notify affected users.</p>
